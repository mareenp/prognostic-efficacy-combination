# prognostic-efficacy
R Code for the article "Performance evaluation of a new prognostic-efficacy-combination design in the context of telemedical interventions" by Mareen Pigorsch, Martin MÃ¶ckel, Stefan Gehrig, Jan C. Wiemer, Friedrich Koehler and Geraldine Rauch

* **What the project does:**
This is the R code used for the simulations in the manuscript "Performance evaluation of a new prognostic-efficacy-combination design in the context of telemedical interventions".

* **Why the project is useful:**
The investigated design allows to define a biomarker cut-off and to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a biomarker-selected population within a single study. This methodological research work evaluates if a double use of the control group for biomarker cut-off definition and efficacy assessment within the RCT leads to biased treatment effect estimates. 

* **How users can get started with the project:**
Download the uploaded R-files and run "sim1_define_function.R" and "sim2_call_function_scenarios.R" for the simulations and "sim3_print_results.R" for an overview of the results.

* **Where users can get help with your project:**
See the above-mentioned article.

* **Who maintains and contributes to the project:**
The code was written by Mareen Pigorsch.
